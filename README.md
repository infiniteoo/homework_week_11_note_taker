# University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp - Fall 2020 
## Assignment #11 Express Homework: Note Taker
<br/>


### Overview

The focus of this assignment was to create a database-centric Note Taker with pre-supplied front end code, and create a Node Express.js server backend to interact with it.  The notes should persist while the server runs, and the user can create new notes, review the current database of notes, or delete notes.

### Credit of Code & Context

Like many people around the world, the impact of Covid-19 has hit close to home, as I've recently lost my house, my job, and had to re-locate across country in seek of new opportunity.  Currently, this bootcamp is all I really have going for myself, as it appears of my career of 20+ years in the radio industry may be coming to an end.  Full time jobs have all but disappeared from that field.  Needless to say, this class is very important to me, and this all tragically coincided with the most important week of class (so far): Node Express.js.  

I left my house in Minnesota at 2pm on Saturday, right after class ended, with the expectation to be in my new apartment in Boise by Tuesday at 5:30pm for my Tuesday class.  I moved into one of these pre-wired-for-fiber apartment complexes, where the cable modem is already installed, and all the new resident has to do is go to centurylink.com/on and you'll be at blazing fast gigabit speeds in a minute.  In Theory!  That does not apply when the apartment's previous resident breaks their lease and lets their internet connection lapse to collections.  So for five days, eight coversations with eight Century Link reps, and a technician in my house were still UNABLE to fix the problem.  It was only when the apartment manager paid the previous tenant's internet bill was I able to finally get online.  With all of that stress trying to even comprehend this week's assignment was a challenge.  Time ran out.

Let me first say that I was able to complete about 50% of the project by myself.  I was able to set up the basic server execution, got the HTML routes working, and the project was deployed to Heroku.  I had major issues trying to implement the API routes, and studying with no internet connection, and a head ful of stress, proved impossible.  I still needed to submit something, so I decided to cheat and copy a fellow student's API routes so the project would work and be completed.

This section is specifically dedicated to giving credit where credit is due: fellow student Kristina Hamilton.  I peeked at her code, and took what was needed.  I know is bad, but I am doing it with the intention of learning what I did't know from her code, and re-creating my own version for re-submission later.  I figured I should at least have a working version for my own records, so in the future when I need to reference this, I will have a working version to learn from.

So that being said: I fully expect, encourage and recommend you cut my final grade for this assignment as much is needed for the missing work I should have done on my own.  I apologize, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.  I figured I should at least do as much as I can, and get credit where credit can be earned: deployed project, half finished code (of my own making), and a proper README.md.

Thank you.


### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/infiniteoo/homework_week_11_note_taker`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell, input the command: `code .`
