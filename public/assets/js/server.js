/*
The following API routes should be created:


GET /api/notes - Should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.


POST /api/notes - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.


DELETE /api/notes/:id - Should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
